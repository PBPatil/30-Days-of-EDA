# 30-Days-of-EDA
A comprehensive exploration of various techniques to uncover patterns and draw valuable insights from data.

Welcome to the **"30 Days of EDA"** learning series, a comprehensive exploration of various techniques to uncover patterns and draw valuable insights from data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential component of the data science process. It goes beyond creating visually appealing plots; it's about comprehending your data and laying the groundwork for impactful machine learning models.

By the end of this series, you will have refined your EDA skills, gained confidence in handling diverse datasets, and become well-prepared to tackle Kaggle competitions and real-world data projects with finesse. Additionally, you'll have a supportive community of fellow data enthusiasts to learn from and grow with!

The primary areas of focus in this series will include the following topics
(not necessarily in the same order):

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Univariate Analysis
- Bivariate Analysis
- Multivariate Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Outlier Detection and Handling
- Data Visualization Techniques
- Statistical Hypothesis Testing
- and much more!

The discussion posts will feature concise code snippets and functions that you can bookmark for quick reference.

So starting tomorrow, are you prepared to embark on a 30-day journey that will undoubtedly enhance your approach to data analysis?

Happy Learning
